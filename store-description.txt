Have you ever browsed Reddit and wanted to share an image, GIF or video with friends, only to find out that the posts don't embed properly?
Well, be slightly invonvenienced no more!
Reddit Embed Linker is an open source web extension that adds a button to Reddit posts that copies a link of the media in the post to the clipboard. This allows you to quickly share this link and make it embed in services like Discord. 

How does it work?
This extension scans for specific elements in the page. Based on that information it is able to place the button and copy the media links.

What about privacy?
This extensions shares no data whatsoever and never will. 
The only data that is used is strictly necessary to make the button work, this data is not shared and is automatically forgotten when the script finishes.

Note: Linked videos that were directly uploaded to Reddit do not have sound due to the way the Reddit video player works

Natively compatible Google Chrome and Firefox.
